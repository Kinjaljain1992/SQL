AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS : 
SQL aggregate functions are used to perform the calculations on multiple rows of a single column
and returns a single value.

TYPES OF AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS ARE:
• Count()
• Sum()
• Avg()
• Min()
• Max()

COUNT : Used to return number of rows in a table.

SYNTAX- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;
        SELECT COUNT(column1) FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;

#Consider the 'employees' table and write the query to count the number of rows in the 'employees' table.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

AVG() : Used to find average value of numeric column .
SYNTAX- SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE<condition>;

#Write the query to calculate the average value of the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT AVG(empSalary) FROM employees;

SUM() : Used to find total sum of column .
SYNTAX- SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;

#Write the query to calculate the sum of values in the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT SUM(empSalary) from employees;

MIN() : Used to find smallest value in selected column .
SYNTAX- SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;

#Write the query to retrieve the minimum value from the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT MIN(empSalary) FROM employees;

MAX() : Used to find largest value in selected column
SYNTAX- SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;

#Write the query to retrieve the maximumvalue from the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT MAX(empSalary) FROM employees;


#Write the query to group records and calculate aggregate functions for the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT empSalary , COUNT(empSalary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY empSalary;

#Write the query to select all empnames whose average is greater than 30000 from the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT empName , AVG(empSalary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY empName
HAVING AVG(empSalary)>30000;

#Write the query to select all employee names whose sum is smaller than 30000 from the 'empSalary' column in the employees table
SELECT empName , AVG(empSalary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY empName
HAVING AVG(empSalary)<30000;
