DATABASE:-A database is an organized collection of data.
For Example: A university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc.

DBMS(Data Base Management System):- The software which is used to manage databases is called Database Management System. 
• DBMS allows users to create ,read , update and delete data in database.
For example:
MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, PostgreSQL are the popular commercial DBMS used in different applications.

WHY DBMS?
• Data Storage
• Data abstraction
• Controls data redundancy
• Multi - user access and views
• Security

DATA MODELS:- Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modelled. 
• Data models define how data is connected to each other ,how they are processed and stored inside the system.

• Hierarchical Model
• Network Model
• Entity Relationship Model
• Relational Model
• No SQL

RELATIONAL MODEL:-In this model , the data is organized in the form of two dimensional table. 
• That means data is stored in the form of rows and columns.
For example:
The table here shows “STUDENT DETAILS” with attributes such as Stu_Id, Name and Branch which has 5 records.
Stu_Id         Name         Branch
201            John          CSE
202            Mary          ECE
203            Britto        IS
204            Harry         IT
205            Steve         ME

RDBMS:-RDBMS is a program which is used to manage Relational databases in which data is stored in the form of rows and columns which can be easily retrieved ,managed and updated.

MySQL:- MySQL is an open source relational database that uses structured query language to interact with databases.
• It stores data in the form of table and can be modified using SQL.
 WHY MySQL ?
• Easy to use
• Cost effective
• Secured
• Platform-Friendly
  

SQL:- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
• SQL is a database programming language designed for the retrieval and management ofdata in a relational database.  
• All relational database management systems like MySQL ,Oracle , MS Access and SQL server uses SQL as their standard database language.

WHAT SQL DOES?
• SQL is used to create new databases and tables.
• SQL execute queries against a database.
• SQL is used to retrieve, update and insert records into a database.
• SQL used to create stored procedures and views in a database.
• SQL can also set permissions on tables, procedures and views.
